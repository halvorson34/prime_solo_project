# BigHearts

Duration: 2 week sprint

## Description

BigHearts is an application designed to improve communication between animal shelters and its volunteers. Two unique interfaces are available, one as a volunteer and the other as a shelter admin. Volunteers can enter feedback, see what tasks need to be done on site, check out what dogs need attention, and view messages posted by shelter admins. Shelter admins can view submitted feedback, update messages to the message board, add and delete animals listed on the application, and create a task list for volunteers to complete.
